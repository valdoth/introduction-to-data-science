    "\n",
    "Autoregression (AR) is a time series model that uses observations from previous time steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step. AR works in a similar way to **autocorrelation**: in both cases, we're taking data from one part of a set and comparing it to another part. An AR model regresses itself. "

    "## ARMA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARMA** stands for Auto Regressive Moving Average, and it's a special kind of **time-series** analysis. So far, we've used autoregression (AR) to build our time-series models, and you might recall that AR models rely on values that remain relatively stable over time. That is, they can predict the future very well, as long as the future looks roughly the same as the past. The trouble with predicting the future is that things can suddenly change, and as a result, the future doesn't look much like the past anymore. These sudden changes &mdash; economists call them *endogenous shocks* &mdash; can be as big as a hurricane destroying a city or an unexpected increase in the minimum wage, and they can be as small as a new restaurant opening in a neighborhood or a single person losing their job. In our data, the air quality might be changed if there was a nearby forest fire, or if a building collapsed near one of the sensors and raised a giant cloud of dust. \n",

    "\n",
    "Our predictions lose power over time because the model gets farther and farther away from its beginning. But what if we could move that beginning forward with the model? That's what **walk-forward validation** is. In a walk-forward validation, we re-train the model at for each new observation in the dataset, dropping the data that's the farthest in the past. Let's say that our prediction for what's going to happen at 12:00 is based on what happened at 11:00, 10:00, and 9:00. When we move forward an hour to predict what's going to happen at 1:00, we only use data from 10:00, 11:00, and 12:00, dropping the data from 9:00 because it's now too far in the past."

    "We've already seen that **parameters** are elements that a machine learning model learns from the training data. **Hyperparameters**, on the other hand, are elements of the model that come from somewhere else. Data scientists choose hyperparameters either by examining the data themselves, or by creating some kind of automated testing of different options to see how they perform. Hyperparameters are set before the model is trained, which means that they significantly impact how the model is trained, and how it subsequently performs. One way of thinking about the difference between the two is that parameters come from *inside* the model, and hyperparameters come from *outside* the model.\n",

    "When we think about hyperparameters, we think in terms of `p` values and `q` values. `p` values represent the number of lagged observations included in the model, and the `q` is the size of the moving average window. These values count as hyperparameters because we get to decide what they are. How many lagged observations do we want to include? How big should our window of moving averages be?"

    "\n",
    "A **rolling average** is the mean value of multiple subsets of numbers in a dataset. For example, I might have data relating to the daily income for a shop I own, and as long as the shop stays open, I can calculate a rolling average. On Friday, I might calculate the average income from Monday-Thursday. The next Monday, I might calculate the average income from Tuesday-Friday, and the next day, I might calculate the average income from Wednesday to Monday, and so on. These averages *roll*, giving me a sense for how the data is changing in relation to any kind of static construct. In this case, and in many data science applications, that construct is time. Calculating rolling averages is helpful for making accurate forecasts about the ways data will change in the future."
