We can see some books contain similar images (maps) and some books contain similar symbols (e.g. the Greek letters $\\Sigma$ and $\\pi$). We say the books containing maps are similar and that they are different from the books containing Greek letters.

    "Let's consider an example of clustering. You may have a data set characterizing your customers like demographic information and personal preferences. A supervised machine learning task would be to predict which class a person belongs to: customers who will purchase your product and customers who won't. In contrast, an _unsupervised_ machine learning task would be to identify several groups or types of customers. With these groups identified, you can analyze the groups and build profiles describing the groups. For example, one group tends to include people from the ages 20 to 25 who like the outdoors. With these profiles, you can pass that information and analysis to the marketing team to create different advertisements to best attract each group."

Now, if we want to use one dimension to describe our data, we would keep $\\xi_1$ and drop $\\xi_2$, ensuring we keep as much of the information in our data set using just one dimension. Further, notice how the new dimensions are not correlated. As we move from lower to higher values of $\\xi_1$, $\\xi_2$ does not predictability increase or decrease."

    "In `scikit-learn`, dimension reduction algorithms are transformers. The choice of having these algorithms as transformers makes sense since they apply a transformation on the data set. Let's illustrate the syntax for the PCA algorithm in `scikit-learn`. For most of these algorithms, the data needs to be centered and scaled to work properly. `PCA` automatically centers the data but **does not** scale it. `StandardScaler` is often used for preprocessing the data prior to applying PCA."
