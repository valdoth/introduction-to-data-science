The initial dataset is typically split into **two** (**training** and **testing**) or **three** (**training**, **validation**, and **testing**) datasets. This helps ensure that the model can generalize. Usually, more data is used for training than for validation or testing. If splitting into two datasets, a good rule of thumb is to split your data randomly into a ratio of **80:20** training:testing. If splitting into three datasets, splitting the data into a ratio of **70:20:10** (training:validation:testing) is commonly used. \n",
